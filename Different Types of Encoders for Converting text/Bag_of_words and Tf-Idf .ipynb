    "paragraph=\"Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: [ˈnəɾendɾə dɑmodəɾˈdɑs ˈmodiː] ⓘ; born 17 September 1950)[b] is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]\""

    "\n",
    "So, ngram_range=(3,3) specifically tells the CountVectorizer to extract only trigrams from the text data. Each trigram consists of three consecutive words from the text. Adjusting ngram_range allows you to control the size of the n-grams extracted and thus the level of context captured in the text representation.\n",

    "\n",
    "This parameter can be useful when you have a large corpus of text data and you want to limit the number of features to reduce the computational complexity or to focus only on the most informative words. However, it's important to note that setting max_features may result in the loss of some information present in the text data, particularly if important words are excluded due to this limitation."
